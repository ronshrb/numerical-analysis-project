# numerical-analysis-project

This is a Python project which was created as part of "Numerical Analysis" course in Ben Gurion University.

### The Assignments:

Assignment 1 - 	In this assignment I built a function called 'interpolate' that interpolate a function in a closed range using at most n points.

Assignment 2 - 	In this assignment I built a function called 'intersections' that finds the intersection points for two functions.
                In this part I used Newton-Raphson and Bisection methods.

Assignment 3 - 	In this assignment I built a function called 'integrate' that integrates a function in a closed range using at most n points.
			          The second function in this part is called 'areabetween' and it finds the area enclosed between two functions.
                In this part I used mid-point, trapezoidal and composite simpson rules.

Assignment 4 - 	In this assignment I built a function called 'fit' that accurately fits the noisy data points
                sampled from some closed shape. In this part I used the Least Squares method.

Assignment 5 - 	In this assignment I built functions called 'fit_shape' and 'area' that fit a model function to
                data I sample from a contour of given shape and calculate the area of that shape.
                In this part I used the shoelace algorithm, and k means.
